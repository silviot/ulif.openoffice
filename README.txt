ulif.openoffice
***************

Bridging Python and OpenOffice.org.

This package provides tools like daemons and converters to ease access
to OpenOffice.org installations for Python programmers.

The main purpose of the whole package is to provide support for
converting office documents from Python using OpenOffice.org but
without the need to have PyUNO support with the Python binary that
actually runs your Python application (like Plone, for instance).

What does `ulif.openoffice` provide?

* ``oooctl``

  A commandline script to start/stop OpenOffice.org as a daemon
  (without X). While OOo brings this functionality out-of-the-box, the
  deamon also monitors status of the OOo server and restarts it if
  necessary.

* ``pyunoctl``

  A commandline script to start/stop a converter daemon, that listens
  for requests to convert office documents from .odt, .doc, .docx,
  etc. to HTML or PDF using OpenOffice.org. Includes a caching
  mechanism that holds docs already converted.

* An API to access any pyunoctl daemon programmatically using Python.

.. note:: POSIX-only!

  The tools provided by `ulif.openoffice` run on POSIX systems (like
  Linux) only!
