CHANGES
*******

0.3 (2010-11-17)
================

* Added option to disable caching completely: set ``--cache-dir`` to
  empty string to disable caching [Thanks to Adama Groszer for
  patches!]

* Removed unwanted output when running in foreground mode.

* Cachemanager now supports listing all sources contained in cache
  dir.

* Fixed bug in cachemanager: under rare circumstances (two different
  input files with same MD5 hash digest *and* identical file stats
  were considered to be identical by the cachemanager and thus led to
  inconsistencies in cache). We now check thoroughly whether two such
  files differ.

* Lots of test fixes [Thanks to Adam Groszer for patches!]

0.2.1 (2010-06-13)
==================

* Fixed fix to cope with pyuno monkey-patching standard __import__
  function. More recent pyuno versions do not do that kind of stuff
  any more (which is an improvement).

* Fixed foreground start of ```oooctl``` server. It didn't work
  correctly with more recent OpenOffice.org/pyuno installs. You now
  don't have to press CTRL-C two times anymore when trying to stop a
  oooctl server running in foreground.


0.2 (2010-05-20)
================

* Added license and copyright file to comply with policy of major
  Linux distributors.

* Added sphinx docs.

* Fixed wrong result path when returning cached HTML results.

* Added mode ``fg`` for ``oooctl``. Using ``oooctl fg`` one can start
  ``oooctl`` in foreground now.

* Added mode ``fg`` for ``pyunoctl``. Using ``pyunoctl fg`` one can start
  ``pyunoctl`` in foreground now.

* Added state check for ``oooctl``: when OpenOffice.org server is down
  during runtime it is restarted automatically. The check happens
  every second.

* Use standard lib `doctest` instead of `zope.testing.doctest`.

* Changed PDF creation: by default now normal PDF (and not PDF/A) is
  created when converting to PDF. This is due to an endianess bug in
  many recent OpenOffice.org binaries running on 64-bit platforms.

0.1 (2010-03-02)
================

* Initial implementation.
