ulif.openoffice.cachemanager -- A cache manager
***********************************************

A cache manager tries to cache converted files, so that already
converted documents do not have to be converted again.

Cache Manager
=============

A cache manager expects a ``cache_dir`` parameter where it can store
the cached files. If this parameter is set to ``None`` no caching will
be performed at all:

    >>> from ulif.openoffice.cachemanager import CacheManager
    >>> cm = CacheManager(cache_dir=None)

If we pass a path, which already exists and is a file, the cache
manager will complain but still be constructed.

If we pass a path that does not exist, it will be created:

    >>> ls('home')

    >>> cm = CacheManager(cache_dir='home/mycachedir')
    >>> ls('home')
    d  mycachedir

The cache manager can register files, look for already created
conversions and pass them back if found.

We lookup a certain document which, as the cache is yet empty, cannot
be found. We create a dummy file for this purpose:

    >>> import os
    >>> open('dummysource.doc', 'w').write('Just a dummy file.')
    >>> docsource = os.path.abspath('dummysource.doc')
    >>> docsource_contents = open(docsource, 'r').read()

    >>> cm.contains(extension = 'pdf', path = docsource)
    False

We can also pass the file contents as argument:

    >>> cm.contains(extension = 'pdf', data = docsource_contents)
    False

The cache is based on MD5 sums of source files. Source documents are
not stored.

We can pass ``level`` to the constructor, if we want a directory level
different to 1:

    >>> cm = CacheManager(cache_dir='home/mycachedir', level=2)
    >>> cm.level
    2

This will result in a different organization of all the cached files
and directories inside the caching directory. See section below to
learn more about this mere internal feature.

Setting the level after creation of a cache manager is not
recommended.

Feeding the cache manager
=========================

We can register conversion results with the cache manager, which will
be available lateron.

Caching PDF files
-----------------

To demonstrate this, we create a dummy source file and a dummy
conversioned file:

    >>> import os
    >>> open('dummysource.doc', 'w').write('Just a dummy file.')
    >>> docsource = os.path.abspath('dummysource.doc')
    >>> docsource_contents = open(docsource, 'r').read()

    >>> open('dummyresult.pdf', 'w').write('I am not a real PDF.')
    >>> pdfresult = os.path.abspath('dummyresult.pdf')

Now we can create a cache manager and register our stuff:

    >>> cm = CacheManager(cache_dir='home/mycachedir')
    >>> cm.registerDoc(source_path=docsource,
    ...                to_cache=pdfresult)

This will create the needed directories inside the cache dir and store
all contents of the directory where the file to cache resides in it.

    >>> ls('home/mycachedir/08/08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2/pdf')
    -  dummyresult.pdf

The path is built from the first two digits if the sources MD5 sum,
the complete md5sum and the ``pdf`` file type marker.

Now the document can be found:

    >>> cm.contains(extension = 'pdf', data = docsource_contents)
    True

Caching HTML files
------------------

When caching HTML we also need to cache accompanied files like images
and the like. We create some faked conversion result in a special
directory:

    >>> htmlresult = os.path.join('htmlresult', 'dummyresult.html')
    >>> os.mkdir('htmlresult')
    >>> open(htmlresult, 'w').write('Some dummy HTML')
    >>> open(os.path.join('htmlresult', 'someimage.jpg'),
    ...      'w').write('Some dummy JPEG')

We also create a subdir, which should not be cached:

    >>> os.mkdir(os.path.join('htmlresult', 'ignoreme'))

Now we can create a cache manager and register our stuff:

    >>> cm = CacheManager(cache_dir='home/mycachedir')
    >>> cm.registerDoc(source_path=docsource,
    ...                to_cache=htmlresult)

The document and the image were really cached:

    >>> ls('home/mycachedir/08/08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2/html')
    -  dummyresult.html
    -  someimage.jpg

Now the document can be found:

    >>> cm.contains(extension = 'html', data = docsource_contents)
    True


Retrieving cached docs
----------------------

The cache manager will return the path to a cached file if it exists
or ``None``:

    >>> cm = CacheManager(cache_dir='home/mycachedir')
    >>> cm.getCachedDocPath(source_path=docsource, ext='html')
    '/.../mycachedir/.../html/dummysource.html'

    >>> cm.getCachedDocPath(source_path=docsource, ext='pdf')
    '/.../mycachedir/.../pdf/dummysource.pdf'

    >>> None is cm.getCachedDocPath(source_path=docsource, ext='blah')
    True

Determining the cache directory
===============================

The cache is organized on-disk as a tree of MD5 sum oriented
directories. This means, if we have a given document (with a
computable MD5 sum), the place where it is stored will depend on the
MD5 sum, the ``level`` of the cache manager and a filename extension.

Say, we have a file with MD5 sum '08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2'
and we look for a PDF conversion of this file, then we can ask:

    >>> cm = CacheManager(cache_dir='home/mycachedir')
    >>> cm.getCacheDir(extension='pdf', 
    ...                md5_digest='08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2')
    '/.../mycachedir/08/08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2/pdf'

Here the first two digits of MD5 sum ('08') serve as directory name
for level one directories.

The trailing dirs are built appending the complete MD5 sum and the
extension (in lowercase).

Each cache manager has a ``level`` attribute, which tells how many
levels of directories should be created. Default is 1.

    >>> cm.level
    1

This avoids to have more than 256 directories in the upper cache
dir. If you expect many files to be cached (i.e. more than 10.000),
you might consider increasing this value.

If we set the ``level`` attribute to a higher value, the cache path
finder will use more directory levels:

    >>> cm.level = 3
    >>> cm.getCacheDir(extension='pdf', 
    ...                md5_digest='08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2')
    '/.../mycachedir/08/86/72/08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2/pdf'

This time the directories '08', '86', and '72' were inserted in the
path.

Note, that changing the directory level of an already caching cache
manager will make all files already cached unfindable!

If we set the directory level to zero, all files will be stored in the
root cache directory:

    >>> cm.level = 0
    >>> cm.getCacheDir(extension='pdf', 
    ...                md5_digest='08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2')
    '/.../mycachedir/08867237840fabae77b838e9c9226eb2/pdf'

As you can see, each converted document gets an own directory for each
cached conversion format determined by the extension.

The conversion results of a pdf created from a source doc with MD5 sum
'1234' will therefore be stored in a directory ``1234/pdf/``, while
the HTML transformation of the same source doc will reside in
``1234/html/``.

We reset the directory level to initial value:

    >>> cm.level = 1
